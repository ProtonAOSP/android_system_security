//! This crate implements the `IKeystoreOperation` AIDL interface, which represents
//! an ongoing key operation, as well as the operation database, which is mainly
//! required for tracking operations for the purpose of pruning.
//! This crate also implements an operation pruning strategy.
//!
//! Operations implement the API calls update, finish, and abort.
//! Additionally, an operation can be dropped and pruned. The former
//! happens if the client deletes a binder to the operation object.
//! An existing operation may get pruned when running out of operation
//! slots and a new operation takes precedence.
//!
//! ## Operation Lifecycle
//! An operation gets created when the client calls `IKeystoreSecurityLevel::create`.
//! It may receive zero or more update request. The lifecycle ends when:
//!  * `update` yields an error.
//!  * `finish` is called.
//!  * `abort` is called.
//!  * The operation gets dropped.
//!  * The operation gets pruned.
//! `Operation` has an `Outcome` member. While the outcome is `Outcome::Unknown`,
//! the operation is active and in a good state. Any of the above conditions may
//! change the outcome to one of the defined outcomes Success, Abort, Dropped,
//! Pruned, or ErrorCode. The latter is chosen in the case of an unexpected error, during
//! `update` or `finish`. `Success` is chosen iff `finish` completes without error.
//! Note that all operations get dropped eventually in the sense that they lose
//! their last reference and get destroyed. At that point, the fate of the operation
//! gets logged. However, an operation will transition to `Outcome::Dropped` iff
//! the operation was still active (`Outcome::Unknown`) at that time.
//!
//! ## Operation Dropping
//! To observe the dropping of an operation, we have to make sure that there
//! are no strong references to the IBinder representing this operation.
//! This would be simple enough if the operation object would need to be accessed
//! only by transactions. But to perform pruning, we have to retain a reference to the
//! original operation object.
//!
//! ## Operation Pruning
//! Pruning an operation happens during the creation of a new operation.
//! We have to iterate through the operation database to find a suitable
//! candidate. Then we abort and finalize this operation setting its outcome to
//! `Outcome::Pruned`. The corresponding KeyMint operation slot will have been freed
//! up at this point, but the `Operation` object lingers. When the client
//! attempts to use the operation again they will receive
//! ErrorCode::INVALID_OPERATION_HANDLE indicating that the operation no longer
//! exits. This should be the cue for the client to destroy its binder.
//! At that point the operation gets dropped.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//! The `IKeystoreOperation` trait is implemented by `KeystoreOperation`.
//! This acts as a proxy object holding a strong reference to actual operation
//! implementation `Operation`.
//!
//! ```
//! struct KeystoreOperation {
//!     operation: Mutex<Option<Arc<Operation>>>,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The `Mutex` serves two purposes. It provides interior mutability allowing
//! us to set the Option to None. We do this when the life cycle ends during
//! a call to `update`, `finish`, or `abort`. As a result most of the Operation
//! related resources are freed. The `KeystoreOperation` proxy object still
//! lingers until dropped by the client.
//! The second purpose is to protect operations against concurrent usage.
//! Failing to lock this mutex yields `ResponseCode::OPERATION_BUSY` and indicates
//! a programming error in the client.
//!
//! Note that the Mutex only protects the operation against concurrent client calls.
//! We still retain weak references to the operation in the operation database:
//!
//! ```
//! struct OperationDb {
//!     operations: Mutex<Vec<Weak<Operation>>>
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This allows us to access the operations for the purpose of pruning.
//! We do this in three phases.
//!  1. We gather the pruning information. Besides non mutable information,
//!     we access `last_usage` which is protected by a mutex.
//!     We only lock this mutex for single statements at a time. During
//!     this phase we hold the operation db lock.
//!  2. We choose a pruning candidate by computing the pruning resistance
//!     of each operation. We do this entirely with information we now
//!     have on the stack without holding any locks.
//!     (See `OperationDb::prune` for more details on the pruning strategy.)
//!  3. During pruning we briefly lock the operation database again to get the
//!     the pruning candidate by index. We then attempt to abort the candidate.
//!     If the candidate was touched in the meantime or is currently fulfilling
//!     a request (i.e., the client calls update, finish, or abort),
//!     we go back to 1 and try again.
//!
//! So the outer Mutex in `KeystoreOperation::operation` only protects
//! operations against concurrent client calls but not against concurrent
//! pruning attempts. This is what the `Operation::outcome` mutex is used for.
//!
//! ```
//! struct Operation {
//!     ...
//!     outcome: Mutex<Outcome>,
//!     ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Any request that can change the outcome, i.e., `update`, `finish`, `abort`,
//! `drop`, and `prune` has to take the outcome lock and check if the outcome
//! is still `Outcome::Unknown` before entering. `prune` is special in that
//! it will `try_lock`, because we don't want to be blocked on a potentially
//! long running request at another operation. If it fails to get the lock
//! the operation is either being touched, which changes its pruning resistance,
//! or it transitions to its end-of-life, which means we may get a free slot.
//! Either way, we have to revaluate the pruning scores.

    /// free operation slot. Prune may also return `Err(Error::Rc(ResponseCode::BACKEND_BUSY))`
    /// which indicates that no prunable operation was found.
    ///
    /// To find a suitable candidate we compute the malus for the caller and each existing
    /// operation. The malus is the inverse of the pruning power (caller) or pruning
    /// resistance (existing operation).
    ///
    /// The malus is based on the number of sibling operations and age. Sibling
    /// operations are operations that have the same owner (UID).
    ///
    /// Every operation, existing or new, starts with a malus of 1. Every sibling
    /// increases the malus by one. The age is the time since an operation was last touched.
    /// It increases the malus by log6(<age in seconds> + 1) rounded down to the next
    /// integer. So the malus increases stepwise after 5s, 35s, 215s, ...
    /// Of two operations with the same malus the least recently used one is considered
    /// weaker.
    ///
    /// For the caller to be able to prune an operation it must find an operation
    /// with a malus higher than its own.
    ///
    /// The malus can be expressed as
    /// ```
    /// malus = 1 + no_of_siblings + floor(log6(age_in_seconds + 1))
    /// ```
    /// where the constant `1` accounts for the operation under consideration.
    /// In reality we compute it as
    /// ```
    /// caller_malus = 1 + running_siblings
    /// ```
    /// because the new operation has no age and is not included in the `running_siblings`,
    /// and
    /// ```
    /// running_malus = running_siblings + floor(log6(age_in_seconds + 1))
    /// ```
    /// because a running operation is included in the `running_siblings` and it has
    /// an age.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// A caller with no running operations has a malus of 1. Young (age < 5s) operations
    /// also with no siblings have a malus of one and cannot be pruned by the caller.
    /// We have to find an operation that has at least one sibling or is older than 5s.
    ///
    /// A caller with one running operation has a malus of 2. Now even young siblings
    /// or single child aging (5s <= age < 35s) operations are off limit. An aging
    /// sibling of two, however, would have a malus of 3 and would be fair game.
    ///
    /// ## Rationale
    /// Due to the limitation of KeyMint operation slots, we cannot get around pruning or
    /// a single app could easily DoS KeyMint.
    /// Keystore 1.0 used to always prune the least recently used operation. This at least
    /// guaranteed that new operations can always be started. With the increased usage
    /// of Keystore we saw increased pruning activity which can lead to a livelock
    /// situation in the worst case.
    ///
    /// With the new pruning strategy we want to provide well behaved clients with
    /// progress assurances while punishing DoS attempts. As a result of this
    /// strategy we can be in the situation where no operation can be pruned and the
    /// creation of a new operation fails. This allows single child operations which
    /// are frequently updated to complete, thereby breaking up livelock situations
    /// and facilitating system wide progress.
    ///

    /// We also allow callers to cannibalize their own sibling operations if no other
    /// slot can be found. In this case the least recently used sibling is pruned.
